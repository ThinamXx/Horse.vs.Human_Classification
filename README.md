# **Horse and Human Classification with CNN**

**Convolutional Neural Network**
- In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.

**Getting the Data**
- I have downloaded the Data and stored in a specific directories using following lines of code.

- **For Training Data**
